Exercise 1
	5.
		d. The DateTime.Now.Year function.
		e. The web server.
Exercise 2
	6. The items that start with "@Html." use Razor syntax.
	   The view knows what model to use for rendering input
	   fields because of the "@model CST356_Week_3_Lab.Data.Entities.User"
	   text at the top of the file.
	8. The copyright text in the footer is the same because
	   they both use the same layout.
	9. An error occured, as there is no index or default
	   page for the User controller.
Exercise 3
	3. The Users data is defined in the view as the
	   "@model IEnumerable<CST356_Week_3_Lab.Data.Entities.User>"
	   at the top of the page.
Exercise 4
	1. When the application returns to the list of users,
	   there is a user with blank input except for the Years
	   In School variable.
	2. Attempting to create a user with at least one required
	   field empty gave the exact expected behavior as in
	   part 3: the page gave an error until all required fields
	   were entered.
